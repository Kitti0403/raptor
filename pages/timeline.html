                      <time>BC. 230–225 Million Yrs.:</time> The first theropod dinosaurs appear in the late Triassic, marking the beginnings of a lineage that would evolve into raptors.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 225–200 Million Yrs.</time> The Herrerasaurus family represents some of the first carnivorous dinosaurs that may have shared some features with later raptors.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 190 Million Yrs.</time> Early raptors like Archaeopteryx, though still quite primitive, show characteristics such as feathers, which later evolved for flight.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 170–160 Million Yrs.</time> Utahraptor and Velociraptor begin evolving into highly specialized predators with advanced hunting skills.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 150–140 Million Yrs.</time> Raptors begin to dominate as some of the top predators of their ecosystems, such as Velociraptor and Deinonychus, which are smaller but incredibly agile and deadly.
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 125–100 Million Yrs.</time> Raptors begin to diversify into various species across the world, evolving into both smaller and larger forms. Achillobator and Bambiraptor are among the species that exemplify the continued specialization of raptors.

                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 95–85 Million Yrs.</time> The rise of Gigantoraptor and other large raptors shows the growing size diversity within the group.
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 75–65 Million Yrs.</time> The apex of raptor evolution occurs, with species such as Tyrannosaurus rex and larger dromaeosaurs like Dakotaraptor ruling over ecosystems.
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 65 Million Yrs.</time> A mass extinction event wipes out all non-avian dinosaurs, including the raptors, marking the end of their reign over the Earth.
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      <time>BC. 64 M. Yrs. - Present</time> Although the raptors themselves went extinct, their legacy lives on in modern birds of prey, which are direct descendants of certain theropods. Modern birds like hawks, eagles, and falcons are considered the living descendants of these ancient predators.
